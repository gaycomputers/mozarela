This is a font based on Fira-Code, Script12, and the work done at this repo: https://github.com/kencrocken/FiraCodeiScript

Basically, someone was charging people 40 bucks for an 'aesthetic' font that combines code friendly unique font ideas, cursive italics, and ligatures, so I made this because I'm not willing to pay that much.


WHAT NEEDS TO BE DONE:

 * I am looking for feedback on individual problem letters (look and functionality)
  
 * I want to add/copy ligatures to the italic font
  
 * Reccomendations very welcome in issues
