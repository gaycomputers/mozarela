This is a font based on Fira-Code, Script12, and the work done at this repo: https://github.com/kencrocken/FiraCodeiScript

Basically, someone was charging people 40 bucks for an 'aesthetic' font that combines code friendly unique font ideas, cursive italics, and ligatures... so I went ahead and made this out of spite.

Also, don't spend 40 bucks on a font kids.
